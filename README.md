This combined Python script contains solutions to various tasks from Parts 1 to 5, covering a range of concepts in Python programming. Here's a breakdown of what the code contains:

Part 1: Basic Calculations and String Operations

Demonstrates basic calculations and string operations using the Python interactive shell.
Part 2: Functions and Modules

Defines a function calculate that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum, difference, product, and quotient as a tuple.
Creates a Python module named math_operations that contains functions for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Writes a Python script that prompts the user to enter their age and categorizes them into "Child", "Teenager", "Adult", or "Senior" using conditional statements.
Implements a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
Part 3: Sequences and Control Flow

Creates a list of favorite books, adds two more books, removes the second book, sorts the list, and creates a tuple.
Generates a multiplication table for numbers 1 to 10 using nested loops.
Writes a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed.
Part 4: Dictionaries, File Handling, and Comprehensions

Defines a dictionary representing a simple address book, implements functions to add, delete, and modify entries, and writes the address book to a file.
Writes a function that reads a text file, counts the occurrence of each word, and returns a dictionary with words as keys and their counts as values.
Implements a basic unit test for the word counting function using Python's unittest module.
Uses list comprehension to create a list of squares of even numbers from 1 to 20, and dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary where the keys are numbers from 1 to 10, and the values are their cubes.
Part 5: Advanced Concepts

Writes a function that can accept any number of positional and keyword arguments and prints them out.
Creates a list of lambda functions that perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Implements a decorator function that measures and prints the execution time of any function it decorates, and uses it to decorate a function that sorts a large list.
Overall, this script covers a wide range of Python concepts, including functions, modules, conditional statements, loops, lists, tuples, dictionaries, file handling, comprehensions, lambda functions, and decorators.
